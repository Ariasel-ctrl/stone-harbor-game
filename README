To play Stone Harbor, visit https://stoneharborgame.com/
or run index.html from this package in a web browser. The game will use an internet
connection if available to download custom fonts and run some analytics (anonymized), but
a net connection is not required. The game engine was tested on modern versions
of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE (10+).

It has been reviewed by an accessibility expert and verified to work with
keyboard controls and with the following screenreaders:
NVDA 2016.1 and Firefox 48.0.2 on Windows 7, (NVDA, JAWS 12) + (Firefox,
Internet Explorer 11) on Windows, and Voiceover + Safari on iOS 10.

The underlying software is in React/Redux (ES6) and is custom to this game.
The source code is licensed under the MIT License. Probably better to use Twine though!
