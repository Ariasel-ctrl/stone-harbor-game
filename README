To play Stone Harbor, run index.html in a web browser. The game will use
an internet connection if available to download custom fonts and run some
analytics (anonymized), but a connection is not required. The game
engine was tested on modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE (10+).

The underlying software is in React/Redux (ES6) and is custom to this game.
The source code is licensed under the MIT License. Probably better to use Twine
though!
